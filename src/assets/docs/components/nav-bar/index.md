<iframe src="./assets/docs/components/nav-bar/main.html"></iframe>

A Nav Bar provides ways for the user to navigate within an app or website through the use of components such as [Tabs](components/tabs).

It is usually used for second level of navigation (sub-pages), while the main navigation is shown in the [App Bar](components/app-bar).

## Functions Slot (Optional)

Functions that apply to the entire page (but no to the entire app or website) can be placed in the functions slot, represented by components such as [Icons](components/icon).
